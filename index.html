                    <strong>Howdy!</strong> My name is Nicholas Martinez and I'm passionate about accessibility.
                    I'm taking this class because I have several friends and family members with disabilities. I think it's
                    important that everyone should have equal access to both information and technology; I wanted to be a part of
                    making the web a more accessible place so that my friends and others like them can have a more positive
                    experience online.
                    
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On top of accessibility, I have a few other interests within the realm of Computer Science.
                    I find <em>artificial intelligence</em> and <em>machine learning</em> fascinating. I'm also really passionate about web design, but I'm
                    more of a backend developer if it isn't obvious from this website.

                <p>
                    Outside of school I love spending my time in nature. I'm also 
                    really passionate about fitness. This has led to my love of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hiking</li>
                    <li>Fishing</li>
                    <li>Cooking</li>
                    <li>Weight Lifting</li>
                    <li>Hunting</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The image attached is actually one that I took at Yellowstone national park. Visting this park was one 
                    of the best trips I've ever taken. I love looking at all the beautiful scenery.
